# Luminescence engine

Designed to make tactical RPGs in the vein of Sega's *Shining Force* series of games. Written for LÖVE 11.4.

This is in an *extremely* preliminary form at the moment and isn't suitable for anything. Seriously, the GitHub repo doesn't even have all the testing files or libraries I'm using, so you're not going to even run it at this point. When it gets to the point where it actually looks like a game, I'll likely release some example files to make it a complete demonstration.
